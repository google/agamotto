## Encoding labels
The raw labels, consisting of bounding boxes and class ids need to be
transformed into targets for training. This transformation consists of
the following steps:
- Generating anchor boxes for the given image dimensions
- Assigning ground truth boxes to the anchor boxes
- The anchor boxes that are not assigned any objects, are either assigned the
background class or ignored depending on the IOU
- Generating the classification and regression targets using anchor boxes
