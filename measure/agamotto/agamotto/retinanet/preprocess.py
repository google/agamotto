## Preprocessing data
Preprocessing the images involves two steps:
- Resizing the image: Images are resized such that the shortest size is equal
to 800 px, after resizing if the longest side of the image exceeds 1333 px,
the image is resized such that the longest size is now capped at 1333 px.
- Applying augmentation: Random scale jittering  and random horizontal flipping
are the only augmentations applied to the images.
Along with the images, bounding boxes are rescaled and flipped if required.
